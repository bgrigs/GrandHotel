Work in Progress...


What did I change in this project? 

-Made gallery flex-wrap so that it would be responsive and wrap according to resizing 

-Added column reverse for improved UX as users are used to scrolling all the way down to see contact info. 

-Made site responsive for iphone SE as this is still commonly used in 2020

-Adjusted height to make site responsive for ipad pro

-Got rid of sidebar for mobile and placed hamburger menu in upper right corner

Still need to...

-change color of hamburger menu (mobile) for better accessibility?

-make navigation copyright visible on safari and chrome (mobile, as of now only working on safari)

-make mobile hamburger menu a little smaller and/or add mroe padding

-Add border-bottom to links in fotter
